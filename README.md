This application is built using a variety of components, including the iOS Navigation Controller, Swift loops, Cocoapods and the Swift Package Manager, Firebase Firestore as a cloud database, Firebase Authentication, and iOS Table View.

One of the standout features of this application is its integration with Firebase, a comprehensive suite of cloud-based tools that offer everything from real-time database storage to user authentication and analytics. This iOS Chat Application also makes use of custom UI elements designed using .xib files. These user interface elements offer a personalized touch and can help users quickly identify and navigate through their chat history.

I made this project based on what Iâ€™ve learned from iOS Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
